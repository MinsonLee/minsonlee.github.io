Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub. (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

 If you are familiar with VMs, you may be thinking this is pretty much just like running a virtual machine, except with a central repository of VM images. And in this simple example, that is basically true. But as you go through these exercises you will start to see important ways that Docker and containers differ from VMs. For now, the simple explanation is this:

The VM is a hardware abstraction: it takes physical CPUs and RAM from a host, and divides and shares it across several smaller virtual machines. There is an OS and application running inside the VM, but the virtualization software usually has no real knowledge of that.
A container is an application abstraction: the focus is really on the OS and the application, and not so much the hardware abstraction. Many customers actually use both VMs and containers today in their environments and, in fact, may run containers inside of VMs.
